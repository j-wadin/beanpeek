# ðŸ«˜ Beanpeek

**Beanpeek** is an educational Spring Boot project designed to inspect and explore Spring Beans using Java Reflection.  
It was built as a learning exercise to better understand how Spring manages components, and how to introspect runtime metadata in a Spring application.

##  Features

- List all Spring Beans in the application context
- Filter and display only your own application beans
- Group beans by source (application, Spring Boot, internal)
- Display annotations on beans and their methods

##  Learning Goals

This project helps you learn to:

- Use `ApplicationContext` to interact with Spring Beans
- Apply Java Reflection to inspect class and method metadata
- Understand annotations and how frameworks like Spring use them

##  Dependencies

- Java 21+
- Spring Boot 3.2
- Maven

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
